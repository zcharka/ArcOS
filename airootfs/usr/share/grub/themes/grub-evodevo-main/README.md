# Grub EvoDevo

Grub EvoDevo is a configurable GRUB theme with scalable graphics, background blurring,
and antialiased true-type fonts. Any wallpaper (e.g., your desktop wallpaper) can be
used as theme background.

The style of the EvoDevo menu can be narrow, wide, or maximal. A narrow-style menu
has rounded corners, a header that can be colored independently, and rectangular
entries without margins. A wide-style menu has square corners; the header cannot be
colored differently; the entries are rounded and do not extend to menu borders. A
maximal-style menu is fully transparent; the menu title is larger and followed
by a horizontal separator.

EvoDevo is configured by changing the value of variables in the installation
script. The most important variables are screen width, screen height, and font
size. All graphics are scaled as a function of font size, so the theme can be
made to look good at any screen resolution. Menu colors, amount of blurring,
dimensions, position, font family, and menu messages can also be configured.

The following screenshots show examples of narrow-style, wide-style, and
maximal-style menus.

The last screenshot shows what EvoDevo looks like with the provided default
wallpaper and without any custom configuration except for screen width, screen
height, and font size.

In all cases, the install script detects your GRUB menu entries and assigns
emblems/icons to them automatically. If an entry distro is not recognized,
it is assigned a hashbang (#) as emblem.


# How it works

GRUB does not do font antialiasing natively, so EvoDevo uses a workaround to
achieve non-pixelated menu entries. Everything in the EvoDevo menu is built
from antialiased PNG files.

For each entry in your `grub.cfg` file, the install script builds a corresponding
SVG document with an entry emblem and the entry string. This SVG document is then
converted to a **fake entry**—a PNG picture that GRUB will display as if it were
an icon on the left side of each entry.

GRUB still displays the text of actual entries alongside the fake ones, however,
so we mask the right side of the menu with a PNG image split from the background
wallpaper. Also, we cover the borders around each fake entry by sandwiching the
entries between two additional PNG layers. The bottom layer is just the menu
background. The top layer is a duplicate of the bottom layer, except for a
series of hollow contours that let the fake entries show through.


# Limitations

## No support for Fedora

EvoDevo has been tested successfully on Arch, elementary OS, Kubuntu, and
Linux Mint. However, EvoDevo assumes that the GRUB updating command on your
system is `grub-mkconfig` and that your GRUB configuration file, `grub.cfg`,
is located at `/boot/grub/`.

Thus, **Fedora**, or more generally, any distribution that relies on
`grub2-mkconfig` instead of `grub-mkconfig`, **is not supported.**


## Incompatibility with UKI

If your booting process involves a
[Unified Kernel Image](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Unified_kernel_image) (UKI),
then EvoDevo's GRUB menu will look **partially or totally empty**.

The reason: UKI menu entries are generated dynamically at boot time and kept in
memory. They are never written in `grub.cfg`, so there is no way the EvoDevo
install script could locate these entries and build the corresponding menu
items. The menu will be fully functional, but empty-looking.

TLDR: EvoDevo **should not be installed on a system with UKI**.

# Dependencies

Aside from a functional POSIX system, EvoDevo requires:

- **ImageMagick** or **GraphicsMagick** to resize, crop, and blur your chosen
wallpaper.

- **rsvg-convert** or **Inkscape** to convert SVG documents to PNG files. Of
these two programs, `rsvg-convert` is the most lightweight, and it may well
be installed on your system without you knowing it. If you choose or need
to install `rsvg-convert`, look for a package named along the lines of
`librsvg` or `librsvg2`.


# Before starting

To configure the install script, you will need to know the width and height
of your screen in pixels **at boot time**. These values must be those used by
GRUB before your graphic driver is loaded, so **do not try to read them from
your desktop environment**.

Instead, **reboot your computer**, and type `c` when the GRUB menu shows up. This
will open a command line with a prompt (`>`). Type `videoinfo` [Enter], and GRUB
will print a list of screen resolutions. The one used at boot time **is prefixed
by an asterisk** (*). For example, with this list:

```
  0x000  320 x  200 x 32 (1280)  Direct color, mask: 8/8/8/8  pos: 16/8/0/24
  0x006  320 x  240 x 32 (1280)  Direct color, mask: 8/8/8/8  pos: 16/8/0/24
  0x007  320 x  200 x 32 (2560)  Direct color, mask: 8/8/8/8  pos: 16/8/0/24
* 0x008 1600 x 1200 x 32 (6400)  Direct color, mask: 8/8/8/8  pos: 16/8/0/24
  0x009 1280 x  800 x 32 (5120)  Direct color, mask: 8/8/8/8  pos: 16/8/0/24
```

boot-time resolution is 1600 x 1200 pixels.


# Installation

First, **create a directory** (say, "evodevo") somewhere on your computer.

Second, scroll back to the top of this page and have a look at the file tree.
One of the files is called, **evodevo.zip**. This zip archive contains all
that you need to install EvoDevo.

Right-click on evodevo.zip to open a context menu, and choose the "**Open
Link in New Tab**" option. From this new tab, GitHub will give you the opportunity
to download the raw archive by clicking on the **Raw** button or the associated
download icon.

Once evodevo.zip saved on your computer, put it in the directory you just
created, and **unpack the archive**:

```
unzip evodevo.zip
```

This will provide you with two shell scripts, `install.sh` and `uninstall.sh`,
and two subdirectories, `data/` and `wallpapers/`. The `data/` subdirectory
contains a list of SVG data needed to create entry emblems. The `wallpapers/`
subdirectory contains the default wallpaper.

Finally, make sure that the install and uninstall scripts are **executable**:

```
chmod u+x install.sh uninstall.sh
```


# Wallpaper setting

If you want to use your own wallpaper, add it to the `wallpapers/` subdirectory.
Your wallpaper file must be a valid JPG or PNG picture, in 8-bit or 16-bit RGB
color mode without interlacing.

The width and height of your wallpaper should not necessarily equal those of the
screen at boot time, as the install script will automatically resize your picture
to the correct dimensions. To avoid shape distortions, however, your wallpaper
aspect ratio should preferably match that of the boot-time screen.


# Configuration

Before installing the theme as root, open `install.sh` in your favorite text
editor. The `VARIABLE=VALUE` assignments that need to be configured appear at
the start of the script, in the section titled:

```
# ------------------------------------------------------------
# CONFIGURATION
# ------------------------------------------------------------
```

Each assignment has a default value and is followed by comments (`# ...`)
designed to help you in configuring the theme. The most important assignments
are the first three ones (about `ScreenWidth`, `ScreenHeight`, and `FontSize`),
followed by the name of your wallpaper file (`Wallpaper=...`).

As a first pass, all of the other assignments could be left as is. Change their
values only if you feel the need for it, previewing the changes at each step
(as explained below).

Once done, run the install script it as root:

```
sudo ./install.sh
```

If everything goes well, the script will conclude with the following
message:

```
-----------------------------
Theme installed successfully!
-----------------------------
You can now reboot your computer to see what the theme looks like.
Alternatively, if instead of rebooting you just want to preview
the results, you can use any image viewer to open:

/usr/share/grub/themes/evodevo/panel-back.png
/usr/share/grub/themes/evodevo/panel-front.png

and

/usr/share/grub/themes/evodevo/icons/*png
```

If you do **not** see this message, then something went wrong (and the script will
probably tell you what). A dependency may be missing, for example. The worst kind
of error would be to forget to quote a `VALUE WITH BLANKS IN IT` or to forget a
closing quote (as this would wreak havoc on the whole shell script).

Once you are satisfied with your configuration, reboot your computer to have
the EvoDevo GRUB theme show up.


## Warnings

Depending on your distribution, using ImageMagick as image processor may
lead to warning messages about a "deprecated convert command". These
warning messages, however, do not impede theme installation.


# Theme maintenance

Grub EvoDevo adds custom classes (`--class menuitem1`, `--class menuitem2`,
...) to the menu entries in your `grub.cfg` file. These classes are used to
fetch the pictures/icons of the fake entries visible on the screen.

Hence, whenever your system overwrites `grub.cfg` (this will happen on any
GRUB or kernel update, for example), the custom classes will be wiped out
and if you do not reinstall EvoDevo, **the fake entries will not show up
on reboot**:

![empty-menu](example-empty.png)

This may look scary, but the real entries are still there (hidden on the right
side of the screen) and GRUB remains fully functional. Pressing the arrow keys,
for example, will still move the focus up and down.

So you can just wait for your default entry to boot. After booting, you will
always be able to restore EvoDevo by running `sudo ./install`.

TLDR: **Whenever your distribution updates GRUB**, run `sudo ./install.sh`
to **restore the theme**.

Do check carefully, however, for the possibility of breaking changes in
GRUB. Your distribution should keep you informed about these.

The theme can be uninstalled at any time by running `sudo ./uninstall.sh`.


# Troubleshooting / FAQ

**Q**: I am positive **Inkscape is installed**, yet `./install.sh` aborts with
this error message: "`neither rsvg-convert nor Inkscape was detected.`"

**A**: Your software center may have installed Inkscape with Flatpak or Snap.
Try to uninstall Inkscape, then reinstall it directly via your system package
manager (e.g., `apt` or `pacman`).

**Q**: I am positive EvoDevo is installed. Yet, **nothing shows up on
reboot**—only the GRUB console.

**A**: Some distributions hide the GRUB menu by writing the following in
`/etc/default/grub`:

```
GRUB_TIMEOUT_STYLE=hidden
GRUB_TIMEOUT=0
```

To be able to see the themed GRUB menu on reboot, you'll need to edit
`/etc/default/grub` as root (e.g., with `sudo nano`) and change these lines to:

```
GRUB_TIMEOUT_STYLE=menu
GRUB_TIMEOUT=15
```

(The value of 15 seconds is just an example, the idea is to leave enough time
for the non-hidden menu to show up.)

Then reinstall EvoDevo (`sudo ./install.sh`) before rebooting.

**Q**: I have installed EvoDevo with my custom wallpaper, but the theme does
not load, and instead **another background picture shows up**.

**A**: This picture is probably a residue of another GRUB customization, left
under the `/boot/grub/` directory. Please have a look at what `/boot/grub/`
contains. If some JPG or PNG file is listed under this directory, move the
file out of the way, or it will interfere with theme installation.

**Q**: I have checked that **my wallpaper is a valid 8-bit or 16-bit JPG or PNG**
picture, yet GRUB still complains about "png bits" or "png color range" errors.

**A**: In a few cases, GRUB may not decode a wallpaper picture correctly. This
is more likely to occur if your wallpaper has a restricted RGB profile with
only a few colors in it. Try to increase the color range by adding smooth gradients
to your picture. If everything fails, you may have no other choice than trying
another wallpaper—preferably a photograph with a rich color profile.

**Q**: I have installed EvoDevo, but the menu looks slightly ugly, and I see
**some faded text on the right of the screen**.

**A**: Your wallpaper is not 100% opaque. Open it in Gimp (or any other
similar software) to remove the alpha channel (i.e., transparency).

**Q**: I have installed EvoDevo, but the **menu looks empty**.

**A**: Your system may have completed an automatic update after you installed
the theme, but before rebooting. Try to reinstall EvoDevo, then reboot yet another
time. If the error persists, check whether your system uses UKI (Unified Kernel
Image) for booting. If you do no use any UKI, please create an issue on GitHub.
